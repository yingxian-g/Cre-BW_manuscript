This code include analysis for:

```Fig. 2a-c```: Relationships between Cre/BW quartiles and diabetes incidence, further stratified by gender and ethnicity.

```Fig. 3a-c```: Relationship between Cre/BW ratio and diabetes incidence in adjusted proportional hazards model 3, further stratified by gender and ethnicity.

```Fig. 4a-g```: Kaplan-Meier analysis of diabetes risk based on Cre/BW ratio.

```Fig. 5a-b```: Spearman correlation between Cre/BW ratio and BFM and SMM.
